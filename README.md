## How to Clone Your Repository

Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click the green "<> Code" button.

Make sure "HTTPS" is selected (or "SSH" if you've set up SSH keys â€“ HTTPS is simpler for now).

Copy the URL. It will look something like https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git.

Open your terminal/Git Bash.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project locally (e.g., cd Documents/Projects).

Run the clone command:git clone
https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
